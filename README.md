The Pullat project is a secure and scalable ASP.NET Core web application that focuses on delivering authenticated user interactions through a decoupled architecture. It relies on an external service named REST to handle all authentication-related tasks such as user login, registration, and JWT token generation. Upon successful login, Pullat receives a token from the REST service, which it then uses to authorize user actions and access protected API endpoints. This separation of concerns allows Pullat to remain focused on its core functionality while ensuring clean, maintainable code and centralized identity management.
